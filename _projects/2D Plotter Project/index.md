title: 2D Plotter Project
description: Developed and built a 2D plotter capable of drawing patterns and shapes on paper using stepper motors, timing belts, and a pen holder. The system was controlled by an Arduino microcontroller with G-code-based commands, translating digital input into precise 2D movements.In addition to building the system, I also mentored students from lower semesters, guiding them through the assembly and programming process. A key part of the project involved analyzing and correcting design flaws from a pre-existing prototype, ensuring a more reliable and precise operation.
skills: 
- Arduino Programming (C/C++)
- Stepper Motor Control & Driver Circuits
- Mechanical Design & Assembly (linear guides, pen holder)
- G-code Processing & Motion Control
- CAD & Prototyping (SolidWorks, 3D-printed parts)
- Team Collaboration & Project Documentation
