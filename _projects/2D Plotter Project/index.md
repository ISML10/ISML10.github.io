title: 2D Plotter Project
description: Built a 2D plotter prototype capable of drawing patterns and shapes on paper using stepper motors, timing belts, and a pen holder. The system was controlled by an Arduino microcontroller with G-code-based commands, translating digital input into precise 2D movements. The project demonstrated the integration of mechanics, electronics, and software into a functional mechatronic system.

- Arduino Programming (C/C++)
- Stepper Motor Control & Driver Circuits
- Mechanical Design & Assembly (linear guides, pen holder)
- G-code Processing & Motion Control
- CAD & Prototyping (SolidWorks, 3D-printed parts)
